# Stackoverflow Insights

Project notes for weekly sessions on Thursday available [here](https://paul-kelly-dit.github.io/)

### Estimations

| Story Points  | Time |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | < 4 hours |
| 2  | 1 day  |
| 3  | 2 days |
| 5  | 4 days |

Anything greater than story point 5, we should break down into a smaller story.

Our goal is to reproduce similar features detailed in the Stack Overflow Insights for 2018
